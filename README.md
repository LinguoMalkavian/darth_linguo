This is a project to test ways to improve neural network based language models through the
use of ungrammatical data. It contains scripts to generate ungrammatical data as well as
neural network based clssifiers that can be trained on them, it is very much a work in progress.

This project contains the research code for my research on syntax sensitivity of neural networks,
the research is being conducted as part of my Ph.D in computational linguistics at the CUNY
Graduate Center.
